Forecasting is the use of various applicable analytical methods to project a variable(revenue) into the future. Financial forecasting is a crucial tool for any business because it enables business owners to anticipateÂ profits. The ability to accurately predict fluctuations in revenue allows business owners plan strategy, production and distribution for coming years, overcome cash flow issues and budget accordingly. Forecasts range in sophistication from educated guesses by business owners to complex mathematical studies.

New start-ups incur huge time and capital investments to establish. When the new outlet fails to break even, the site closes within a short time and operating losses are incurred. Finding an algorithmic model to increase the return on investments in new start-up sites would facilitate businesses to direct their investments in other important business areas, like innovation, and training for new employees.
